    Delicious post-meal alternative snack
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 gallon 2% milk</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt with active cultures</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour milk into a pot and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes; do not let it boil over.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and let sit until you can leave your finger dipped into the milk for 10 to 15 seconds without it burning, 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in yogurt; there's no need to stir.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on the pot and carefully wrap a blanket around it. Place the wrapped pot in a slightly warm place where it will be undisturbed for 6 to 10 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the refrigerator to allow the yogurt to continue to thicken.</li>
    </ol>
