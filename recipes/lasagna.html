    <h2>Description</h2>
    Interesting dish which smells fragrant and is delicious
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 x 28 oz. cans tomatoes - crushed or whole is best! </li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li> 1 large onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef, preferably lean</li>
        <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li> Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li> Fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly dice the onion, and mince as much garlic as you want.</li>
        <li>Film sauce pan with olive oil. Heat the pan over medium and cook the ground beef and Italian sausage until browned</li>
        <li>Throw in the onions and garlic</li>
        <li>Stir this around for a few minutes over medium heat until the onions become soft. Then add in a few good pinches of Italian seasoning, a pinch of basil, oregano and salt, and a tablespoon or two of tomato paste</li>
        <li>Open both cans of tomatoes and dump them in. Mix it around for a moment, and bring to a light boil</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to a simmer and cover. Let the sauce simmer for at least a half hour while you do the rest of the prep work</li>
        <li>Cook noodles for the shortest time listed on the package or a minute or two under</li>
        <li>Rinse them with cold water using a colander and set them aside</li>
        <li>Grab out a couple handfuls of parmesan and mozzarella and put them in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Place the ricotta into a large bowl, along with one egg. Add the rest of the parmesan and mozzarella, as well as a couple good pinches of Italian seasoning and basil. Mix this all together with your hands</li>
        <li>Add salt, sugar and fresh basil</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 200 degrees C</li>
        <li>Ladle just enough sauce to cover the bottom of the pan. Then place noodles on top of the sauce just to cover, slightly overlapping</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over the noodles</li>
        <li>Put more sauce over the cheese and then noodles, more cheese, and then sauce again. Repeat the basic build three times</li>
        <li>For the fourth and final level, lay down your cheese mixture and top with the rest of the sauce. Now sprinkle the parmesan and mozzarella you set aside over it</li>
        <li>Now bake at 375 F for 40 minutes - if you're using a metal pan, check after 30 and make sure it's not too dark!</li>
    </ol>
